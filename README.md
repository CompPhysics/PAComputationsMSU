#Computational Physics and related topics at the Physics and Astronomy Department at MSU
This repository contains material pertinent to discussions on how to implement a computational perspective in basic physics courses, with several possible extensions and collaborations across departments at the CNS.
The present working group consists of

Danny Caballero

Sean Couch

Wade Fisher

Morten Hjorth-Jensen

Brian O'Shea

Carlo Piermarocchi

Material will be added gradually. See also the website of [Partnership for Integration of
Computation into Undergraduate Physics](http://gopicup.org) for highly relevant information.

    "\n",
    "Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers\n",
    "numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about\n",
    "developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing\n",
    "algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has\n",
    "always been a central part of education in the sciences and engineering disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the part of students, this competence involves being able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,\n",
    "\n",
    "* derive, verify, and implement algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand what can go wrong with algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and\n",
    "\n",
    "* think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process *per se*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\n",
    "as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\n",
    "general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a\n",
    "general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\n",
    "computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or\n",
    "numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This\n",
    "generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for\n",

    "in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to\n",
    "essentially almost all advanced problems in modern\n",

    "\n",
    "* Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods  for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger classes of problems can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why should basic university education undergo a shift towards modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of the computer on mathematics and science is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.\n",
    "* Computing can increase the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing through programming can be excellent training of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can enhance the understanding of abstractions and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can decrease the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and \"what if\" discussions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Computing competence enlarges the body of tools available to students and\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing in basic physics courses allows us to bring important elements of scientific methods at a much earlier stage in our education.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It gives the students skills and abilities which are asked for by society.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It gives us as university teachers a unique opportunity to enhance students' insights about physics and how to solve scientific problems.\n",

    "Computing means solving scientific problems using all possible tools, including symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms and analytical paper and pencil solutions . \n",

    "* Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models.\n",

    "The impact of the computer on mathematics and science is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.\n",
    "* Computing can increase the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.\n",

    "* Computing through programming can be excellent training of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing can enhance the understanding of abstractions and generalization.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In statistical physics the concept of an ensemble is one of the\n",
    "cornerstones in the definition of thermodynamical quantities. An\n",
    "ensemble is a collection of microphysics systems from which we derive\n",
    "expectations values and thermodynamical properties related to\n",
    "experiment.  As an example, the specific heat (which is a measurable\n",
    "quantity in the laboratory) of a system of infinitely many particles,\n",
    "can be derived from the basic interactions between the microscopic\n",
    "constituents. The latter can span from electrons to atoms and\n",
    "molecules or a system of classical spins. All these microscopic\n",
    "constituents interact via a well-defined interaction.  We say\n",
    "therefore that statistical physics bridges the gap between the\n",
    "microscopic world and the macroscopic world.  Thermodynamical\n",
    "quantities such as the specific heat or net magnetization of a system\n",
    "can all be derived from a microscopic theory.\n",

    "## Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena\n",
    "\n",
    "A phase transition is marked by abrupt macroscopic changes as external\n",
    "parameters are changed, such as an increase of temperature. The point\n",
    "where a phase transition takes place is called a critical point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We distinguish normally between two types of phase transitions;\n",
    "first-order transitions and second-order transitions. An important\n",
    "quantity in studies of phase transitions is the so-called correlation\n",
    "length $\\xi$ and various correlations functions like spin-spin\n",
    "correlations.  For the Ising model we shall show below that the\n",
    "correlation length is related to the spin-correlation function, which\n",
    "again defines the magnetic susceptibility. The spin-correlation\n",
    "function is nothing but the covariance and expresses the degree of\n",
    "correlation between spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena, correlation length\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation length defines the length scale at which the overall\n",
    "properties of a material start to differ from its bulk properties.  It\n",
    "is the distance over which the fluctuations of the microscopic degrees\n",
    "of freedom (for example the position of atoms) are significantly\n",
    "correlated with each other. Usually it is of the order of few\n",
    "interatomic spacings for a solid.  The correlation length $\\xi$\n",
    "depends however on external conditions such as pressure and\n",
    "temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Classification of phase transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "First order/discontinuous phase transitions are characterized by two or more\n",
    "states on either side of the critical point that can coexist at the\n",
    "critical point.  As we pass through the critical point we observe a\n",
    "discontinuous behavior of thermodynamical functions.  The correlation\n",
    "length is normally finite at the critical point.  Phenomena such as\n",
    "hysteris occur, viz. there is a continuation of state below the\n",
    "critical point into one above the critical point. This continuation is\n",
    "metastable so that the system may take a macroscopically long time to\n",
    "readjust. A classical example is the melting of ice. It takes a\n",
    "specific amount of time before all the ice has melted. The temperature\n",
    "remains constant and water and ice can coexist for a macroscopic\n",
    "time. The energy shows a discontinuity at the critical point,\n",
    "reflecting the fact that a certain amount of heat is needed in order\n",
    "to melt all the ice\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second-order phase Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Second order or continuous transitions are different and in general\n",
    "much difficult to understand and model.  The correlation length\n",
    "diverges at the critical point, fluctuations are correlated over all\n",
    "distance scales, which forces the system to be in a unique critical\n",
    "phase. The two phases on either side of the critical point become\n",
    "identical. The disappearance of a spontaneous magnetization is a\n",
    "classical example of a second-order phase transitions. Structural\n",
    "transitions in solids are other types of second-order phase\n",

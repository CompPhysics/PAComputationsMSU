Charge to the PA ADHOC Committee on computers in physics education
Committee members: Caballero, Couch, Fisher, Hjorth-Jensen, O’Shea, Piermarocchi
Firstly, thanks for agreeing to serve on this important committee.
The purpose of this committee is to evaluate the way in which undergraduate and graduate students are currently trained in computational skills, and to propose a path forward.   This could include:
Consideration of whether PA students should be required to have a “minimum skill-set in computational methods”.  If so, what should be included. 
Consideration of the way in which computations should be included in our service courses, including co-ordination with other units that teach large service courses (Math, Chemistry).  
Consideration of existing courses in other departments, such as CMSE and CSE, that could be required or optional for physics or astronomy students, at both the Ugrad and Grad levels.    A list of such courses for circulation to PA students would be helpful.    
Evaluation of the computational physics courses currently offered in the physics and astronomy department, with proposals for changes if needed.
Consideration of the ways in which computational methods and problems can and should be included in the PA core courses.
Consideration of whether PA should develop a computational physics major, or perhaps develop an applied physics major with computational physics as one of the options.   A computational physics option would be co-ordinated with CMSE which is developing program specializations in several directions, including physics. 
Timeline:   A positive outcome of the committee’s work would be a report with recommendations that can be presented to the faculty at a faculty meeting at the end of 
Spring semester 2017, or in Fall semester 2017.   This could include a request for resources from the department for implementation of proposed changes.

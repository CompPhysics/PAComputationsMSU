    "numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about\n",
    "developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing\n",
    "algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has\n",
    "always been a central part of education in the  sciences and engineering disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This  competence involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* overview of important, known algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* reproducible science and ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems\n",
    "\n",
    "All these elements (and many more) are central for  maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process *per se*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\n",
    "as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\n",
    "general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a\n",
    "general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\n",
    "computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or\n",
    "numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This\n",
    "generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for\n",
    "understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a\n",
    "particular problem.\n",

    "Computing competence represents a central element\n",
    "in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to\n",
    "essentially almost all advanced problems in modern\n",
    "societies. Computing competence is simply central to further\n",
    "progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should basic university education undergo a shift from classical mathematics to modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods  for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger problem classes can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much \n",
    "of the classical knowledge about continuous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why should basic university education undergo a shift from classical mathematics to modern computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of the computer on mathematics and science is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.\n",
    "* Computing increases the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing through programming is excellent training of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing enhances the understanding of abstractions and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing decreases the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and \"what if\" discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a deeper understanding of mathematical modeling and the scientific method (we hope, and here our physics education group can play a central role in promiting this). \n",
    "Not only is computing via programming a very powerful tool, it also a great pedagogical aid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the mathematical training, there is one major new component among the arguments above: understanding abstractions and generalization. While many of the classical methods developed for continuous models are specialized for a particular problem or a narrow class of problems, computing-based algorithms are often developed for problems in a generic form and hence applicable to a large problem class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing competence represents thus a central element in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to essentially almost all advanced problems in modern societies. Computing competence is simply central to further progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in deeper insights about scientific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's project in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).\n",

    "## General learning outcomes for computing competence\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for numerical algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deep knowledge of the most fundamental algorithms for linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, optimization, and statistical uncertainty quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overview of advanced algorithms and how they can be accessed in available software.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Knowledge of high-performance computing elements: memory usage, vectorized and parallel algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Understanding of approximation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Application of fundamental and advanced algorithms to classical model problems as well as real-world problems with assessment of the uncertainty in the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for symbolic computing:\n",
    "1. Knowledge of at least one computer algebra system and how it is applied to perform classical mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, differential equations - with verification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for programming:\n",
    "1. Experience with programming in a high-level language (MATLAB, Python, R). Experience with programming in a compiled language (Fortran, C, C++).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Experience with implementing and applying numerical algorithms in reusable software that acknowledges the generic nature of the mathematical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Knowledge of basic software engineering elements: functions, classes, modules/libraries, testing procedures and frameworks, scripting for automated and reproducible experiments, documentation tools, and version control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experience with debugging software, e.g., as part of implementing comprehensive tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for verification:\n",
    "1. Experience with programming of testing procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deep knowledge of testing/verification methods:\n",
    "\n",
    " a. Exact solution of numerical models\n",
    "\n",
    " b. Method of manufactured solutions (choose solution and fit a problem)\n",
    "\n",
    " c. Classical analytical solutions (incl. asymptotic solutions) \n",
    "\n",
    " d. Computing of asymptotic approximation errors (convergence rates)\n",
    "\n",
    " e. Step-wise construction of tests to aid debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for mathematical modeling:\n",
    "1. Experience with deriving computational models from basic principles in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Experience with bringing models on dimensionless form to reduce and simplify input data and increase the understanding of the model by interpreting its dimensionless parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Experience with solving real problems from applied sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes for presentation of results:\n",
    "1. Experience with different visualization techniques for different types of computed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extensive experience with presenting computed results in scientific reports and oral presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is deep knowledge?\n",
    "By deep knowledge we here mean the understanding of the underlying fundamental ideas and concepts from which a plethora of seemingly different methods and technologies can be derived. In other words, the deep knowledge brings structure to all the technical details.\n",
    "Obtaining this type of knowledge requires time in class and a lot of exercises. In addition, the students need to reflect about theory and practice. The reflection process is often difficult to implement. Below are some suggestions.\n",
    "A useful concept is simplify, understand, and then generalize. Giving a superficial overview of a bunch of unrelated methods and their applications to unrelated scientific problems equips the students with a wide toolbox, but fails to enhance a fundamental understanding of how multidisciplinary topics play together. Instead, we believe in the following list.\n",
    "1. Pick a few selected classes of problems, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. start out with simplified models,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. apply general, fundamental ideas to construct algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "4. understand all details to correctly implement the algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "5. understand how to judge the numerical quality of the algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "6. understand how to verify that the computations are mathematically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The verification process forces the student to reflect on all the points: What type of problem is actually solved? How can I test that the solution is right?\n",
    "After obtaining an understanding of the simplified problem, one can generalize the models to real applications, but illustrate how the insight from the simplified models and methods gives very valuable knowledge when attacking the generalizations. The focus on simplified models help to detach the mathematics from a lot of discipline-dependent application details and cultivate the common mathematical and implementational ideas.\n",
    "This philosophy is closely related to the key principle stated earlier:\n",
    "1. solving a complicated problem first starts with the purpose of breaking up the problem into subtasks that belong to general classes of well-studied problems in mathematics,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. each subproblem is understood with great help simplified models in that class,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. and finally a synthesis of the subproblems can solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows here is a list of suggested learning outcomes. Not all may be relevant, but hopefully they can serve as \n",
    "a way to spark off discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning outcomes are subdivided in three general categories, knowledge, skills and general competence.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Central algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The following mathematical formulations of problems from the physical sciences play a prominent role and should be reflected in the way we teach physics:\n",
    " * Ordinary differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. Euler, modified Euler, Verlet and Runge-Kutta methods with applications to problems in electromagnetism, methods for theoretical physics, quantum mechanics and mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Partial differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. Diffusion in one and two dimensions (statistical physics), wave equation in one and two dimensions (mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, methods for theoretical physics) and Laplace's and Poisson's equations (electromagnetism).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Numerical integration \n",
    "\n",
    "  a. Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule and Monte Carlo integration. Applications in statistical physics, methods of theoretical physics, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Statistical analysis, random numbers, random walks, probability distributions, Monte Carlo integration and Metropolis algorithm. Applications to statistical physics and laboratory courses\n",
    "\n",
    " * Linear Algebra and eigenvalue problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "  a. Gaussian elimination, LU-decomposition, eigenvalue solvers, and iterative methods like  Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel for systems of linear equations. Important for several courses, classical mechanics, methods of theoretical physics, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Root finding and interpolation techniques, used in methods for theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, elekctromagnetism and mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve a proper pedagogical introduction of these algorithms, it is important that students and teachers alike see how these algorithms are used to solve a variety of physics problems. The same algorithm, for example the solution of a second-order differential equation, can be used to solve the equations for the classical pendulum in a mechanics course or the (with a suitable change of variables) equations for a coupled RLC course in the electromagnetism course. Similarly, if students develop a program for studies of celestial bodies in the mechanics course, many of the elements of such a program can be reused in a molecular dynamics calculation in a course on statistical physics and thermal physics. The two-point boundary value problem for a buckling beam\n",
    "(discretized as an eigenvalue problem) can be reused in qauntum mechanical studies of interacting electrons in oscilltor traps, or simply the study of a particle in a box potential. \n",

    "We will strongly recommend that Python is used as programming language for all the courses proposed below.

We recommend strongly that the following tools are used\n",

    "5. Other high-level environments like Mathematica and Matlab can also be presented and offered as special courses like PHY102 - Physics Computations I.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks can be used to hand in exercises and projects and give the students a training in presenting their studies in the form of scientific/technical reports.\n",

    "Version control software allows teachers to bring in naturally aspects like reproducibility of science as well as enhancing\n",

There are several interesting problems that can deepen the understanding of newtonian problems, from modeling planetary motion to models for friction and earthquake simulations. With not too advanced programs one can easily bring in actual research problems (friction is a good example).  The classical pendulum is also a good case to illustrate. The code can easily be reused for studies of for example an RLC circuit in electromagnetism. The equations for a buckling beam lead to an eigenvalue problem which can reused in the quantum mechanics course.\n",

The committee envisions two surveys: one for current students and one for recent graduates. Note that "Likert scale" means the response is not open, but rather requests the degree to which the respondent endorses the statement.

<p>
OPEN - refers to open response
MC - refers to multiple choice (select one)
MS - refers to multiple select (select all that apply)
LIKERT - refers to degree of endorsement

<h2 id="___sec4" class="anchor">Courses in computational science and physics </h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU" target="_self">Computational Physics PHY 480/905(section 002)</a></li>
<li> PHY 905 (section 004) High-performance computing"</li>
<li> Scattered elements of computations here and there (<b>not a complete list</b>)</li>
</ul>

Many possible paths in order to improve the situation:

<ul>
<li> Proper graduate course(s) in computational physics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Scientific and educational motivation </h2>

<p>
Numerical simulations of various systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technology.
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.
In between, simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry. These are just a few topics
already well covered at the University of Oslo and that can be
topics for coming thesis projects as well as research directions.

<h2 id="___sec6" class="anchor">Computing competence </h2>

<p>
Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers
numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about
developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing
algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering
education.

<p>
Modern computing competence is about

<ul>
<li> derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms</li>
<li> understanding what can go wrong with algorithms</li>
<li> overview of important, known algorithms</li>
<li> understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems</li>
<li> reproducible science and ethics</li>
<li> algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems</li>
</ul>

The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

<h2 id="___sec7" class="anchor">Possible learning outcomes </h2>

    "\n",
    "* Demands on computing in research continue to grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can we integrate computing in core Physics courses in a coordinated and coherent way? \n",

    "## A large fraction of our students get jobs were computing is central\n",
    "Computational modeling and data analysis is core to a variety of non-academic career paths that are often pursued by physics students following the receipt of their Bachelor's degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2012 AIP (American Institute of Physics) survey of 5,000 recent physics Bachelorâ€™s degree recipients indicated that 50% chose to enter the workforce immediately after receiving their degree. \n",
    "Of these, roughly 75% go into STEM-related fields including engineering, software development, or information technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on sub-field, 60-80% of physics degree-holders in industry regularly need to engage in computer programming, simulation and modeling tasks. \n",
    "Many respondents to the survey stressed the importance of computer skills, including programming, in increasing their marketability to potential employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing as a way to develop intuition about the scientific process\n",
    "The use of computational modeling in the classroom setting provides students with insights that are complementary to those resulting from pencil-and-paper manipulation of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing in core physics courses allows us to bring important elements of scientific methods at a much earlier stage in our students' education.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to closely examine the behavior of systems that are too complex to be easily analytically tractable, or that have no analytic solutions (i.e., many systems of practical interest), helps to develop intuition that is unavailable to many students from analytic calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing competence\n",
    "**Computing means solving scientific problems using all possible tools**, including symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical paper and pencil solutions .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing is about developing an understanding of the scientific method** by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the part of students, this competence involves being able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,\n",
    "\n",
    "* derive, verify, and implement algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand what can go wrong with algorithms,\n",

    "* think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.\n",

    "## Better understanding of the scientific method\n",
    "All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process *per se*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\n",
    "as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\n",

    "general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\n",

    "* Gradually integrate the remaining core (also elective) courses (PHY410, PHY415, PHY451, PHY471, PHY481), keeping pace with the cohort of students on this initial schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop resources to support faculty and ensure continuity over year-to-year transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain program vitality by systematically refreshing computational course material as our programs evolve.\n",
